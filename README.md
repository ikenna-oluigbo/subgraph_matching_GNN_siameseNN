# subgraph_matching_GNN_siameseNN
The aim of this project is to dynamically extract different graph components (subgraphs) in a large network and find the similarities between these subgraphs. 

The aim of this project is to dynamically extract different graph components (subgraphs) in a large network and find the similarities between these subgraphs.

To execute this, we adopt the following techniques:

- The Cantor Bijection function for feature aggregation
- Graph Neural Network (GNN)
- Siamese Neural Network with Contrastive loss for subgraph matching.

The following python libraries are required:
- tensorflow
- tensorflow_gnn
- networkx
- pandas
- numpy
- keras
- Matplotlib (if visualization is required)

For example: pip install tensorflow

Load your data into make_graphs script. Run subgraph_siamesesNN to perform the matching.
